# JamWiki2 #

JamWiki2 is a Java-based wiki application that offers the same syntax as MediaWiki and many of its features. It originated out of a fork of the original JAMWiki project, that has regrettably discontinued active development and support in 2013.

As far as we know, JamWiki2 today is the only Java-based wiki engine that can parse MediaWiki syntax (besides XWiki). It's easy to install, comfortable to use, and a joy to administrate.

## Licensing ##

JAMWiki, the original work by jamwiki.org was and still is licensed under LGPL v2.1. Our derivate work based on this foundation is being licensed under GPL v3.0, because we feel that this is more appropriate for an application, which you most likely will want to run standalone and "as is" rather than want to integrate into some other project.

In effect, GPL 3.0 applies to all files changed in some way through  our enhancements, adoption or customization of the original work, while all unchanged files will stay under the original LPGL v2.1 license. License headers and notice of authorship of changed files were adjusted accordingly.
